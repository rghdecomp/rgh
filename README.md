# Rabbids Go Home Decompilation
This is a WIP decompilation of Rabbids Go Home (Rev 1, Europe).<br>
It aims to be as accurate as possible, matching the recompiled instructions to the original machine code as much as possible.<br>
The goal is to provide a workable codebase that can be modified, improved, and ported to other platforms later on. (GOG, i'm watching you.)<br>
For now, it's ripped/extracted files to use as reference to decompile the game as a whole.<br>
